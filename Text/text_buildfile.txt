[FarLeft]As you can see, the path is heavily guarded.[A][NL]
They'll have griffon riders and pegasus[NL]
riders coming in from all sides, too,[A][NL]
once they realise we're here.[A]
[Right]So we have to move quickly?[NL]
I can do that.[A]
[FarLeft]That's right.[A][NL]
There's also the possibility[NL]
that they'll get people to close in[anl]
from behind us.[a]
[Left]And what of those houses?[NL]
It's a bit odd that people live here, no?[a]
[FarLeft]It's well protected and alongside[NL]
a well traveled road,[anl]
so it's not as bad as you'd think.[NL]
If you try to enter their homes, though,[anl]
I don't know what'll happen.[a]

# 0x0911
[MidLeft][LoadTransporter][MidRight][LoadMC]
[MidRight]So, you got us access?[A][NL]
I'm tired of going around from town[NL]
to town and collecting all the people up.[A]
[MidLeft]Listen. These people would have[NL]
died without us.[A][NL]
If it means saving some lives,[NL]
why wouldn't you be okay with what we've been doing?[A]
[MidRight]It sounds a lot worse when[NL]
you put it like that.[A][NL]
Anyways, we're ready to go, right?[A]
[MidLeft]Yeah. The bridge is heavily guarded,[A][NL]
so a pegasus knight will be coming with[NL]
us to make sure we get across alright.[A]
[MidRight]Then let's get going.[A]
[Clear][MidLeft]
[MidRight]We've wasted enough time already...[A][X]

# 0x0910
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x5B][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh! You must be traveling south.[NL]
Take this with you.[A][X]

# 0x0909
[FarLeft][LoadTransporter][Left][LoadJagen][MidRight][LoadMC]
[MidRight]So what's the plan now?[NL]
And why are we out here, anyways?[A]
[FarLeft]I know someone who can[NL]
get us access to the landbridge[A][NL]
we need to cross to get to safety.[NL]
She lives over in that inn.[A]
[Left]And what of those houses?[A]
[FarLeft]These are soldiers, not bandits.[A][NL]
They'll leave the people in the houses alone,[NL]
but bandits might come out later.[A][NL]
Is everyone clear on what we need to do?[A]
[MidRight]Yep.[A][X]

# 0x0908
[FarRight][LoadMC][Right][LoadTransporter][Left][LoadJagen]
[Left]We have to leave now.[A][NL]
This village is a lost cause,[NL]
and we've saved everyone we can.[A]
[FarRight]Agreed.[A][NL]
Let's get out of here.[A][X]

# 0x0907
[FarRight][LoadTransporter][Right][LoadMC][MidLeft][LoadFace][0x0F][0x1]
[FarRight]Hello there.[NL]
What are you doing out here?[A][NL]
[MidLeft]I'm fleeing this village.[A][NL]
The bandits that have been ravaging[NL]
the entire north have gotten to[A][NL]
my home.[A][NL]
My sister has been left behind,[NL]
but I don't know what to do.[A]
[Right]You can come on with us, then.[A][NL]
We're always happy to accept more[NL]
people.[A]
[FarRight]We can't just leave the village,[NL]
Name.[A][NL]
If there are more folks in danger there,[NL]
take us to your home.[A][NL]
If we can't protect the village,[A][NL]
at least we can help evacuate[NL]
the people there, including your sister.[A][X]

# 0x0905
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1][Left][LoadMC][FarLeft][LoadJagen]
[MidRight]We'll stop here for the night.[A]
[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]
[Left][LoadFace][0x9][0x1][FarLeft][LoadFace][0x8][0x1]
[Left]So, you all are heading south, huh?[A][NL]
Sounds pretty good at a time like this.[A]
[MidRight]Indeed it is.[A][NL]
It's a shame the route is plagued[NL]
by bandits.[A][NL]
It's been rough so far.[A]
[FarLeft]How about we tag along?[A][NL]
We don't have any other plans,[NL]
and we're proficient at fighting.[A]
[MidRight]Seriously?[NL]
Just like that?[A][NL]
I'd be fine with that.[A][NL]
[Left]Just to be clear,[A][NL]
we wouldn't have to bring[NL]
any money or supplies, right?[A]
[MidRight]Ah, there's the catch.[NL]
No, we'll take care of it all.[A][X]

# 0x0906
[MidLeft][LoadMC][MidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[MidLeft]What was that?[A]
[MidRight]Must be bandits![A][NL]
Quick, we have to warn[NL]
the villagers![A]
[MidLeft]Alright.[NL]
We'll need to be quick,[A][NL]
since they probably have more[NL]
backup coming soon,[A][NL]
and from all sides.[A][NL]
We can't afford to slow down.[A][X]

# 0x0918
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x7][0x1]
[OpenFarRight]I can't thank you enough[NL]
for helping me back there.[A][NL]
If you need healing, I'd be more[NL]
than willing to lend you my staff.[A][NL]
And take this money, too.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Thank you so much.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]So, Frederik,[NL]
Where are we off to next?[A]
[OpenRight]We should keep moving south.[A][NL]
We can make it to Town in[NL]
a few days,[A][NL]
and we'll stay there for a night.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]If I may interrupt,[A][NL]
wouldn't staying in one place[NL]
make it easier to be attacked?[A][NL]
[OpenRight]We don't have a choice.[A][NL]
Besides, I doubt we can avoid[NL]
conflict for long.[A][NL]
Town might have some people[NL]
willing to join us.[A]
[OpenLeft]That sounds reasonable[NL]
to me.[A][NL]
Name, are you ready to go?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, I'm ready.[A][X]

# 0x0903
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x50][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x49][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]Now that Father is[NL]
dead, where is his will?[A][NL]
Surely he left the kingdom to[NL]
me, his more competent sun.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He hadn't written it.[NL]
But seeing as I am the eldest,[A][NL]
it is only natural that[NL]
I take his position as king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like hell it is![A][NL]
You're so utterly incompetent,[A][NL]
the country would fall the very day[NL]
you became king![A]
[OpenMidLeft]The order of succession is[NL]
simple, Name.[A][NL]
If I am so incompetent,[NL]
then why not simply wait for me[A][NL]
to fail?[A]
[OpenMidRight]I must be the ruler![A][NL]
Even if you were only in power for one day,[NL]
the damage would take a lifetime to repair.[A][NL]
If you do not subside, I will wage war.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]If it is war you desire, then it is[NL]
war you will receive.[A][NL]
I will mercilessly destroy you[NL]
and show who the true ruler here is.[A][NL]
And from the ashes will rise a new Country[NL]
like there never has been before.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]War...?[NL]
I can't stay here...[A][NL]
Where should I go, though?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps we should seek refuge[NL]
with that old merchant friend of yours?[A][NL]
I don't know of anyone else who would[NL]
take us in.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Brecker, you can't come![NL]
It's too dangerous, you should stay here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know very well I can't leave you[NL]
behind, Name.[A][NL]
Now come, let us make our[NL]
escape with haste.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very well.[A][X]

# 0x0904
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[OpenLeft]Frederik, you've gotta help us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Name?[A][NL]
What are you doing outside of the[NL]
castle? It's dangerous here.[A][NL]
You must know there's been a lot of[NL]
chaos since your brothers[A][NL]
began fighting.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I believe it is no longer[NL]
safe for us anywhere.[A][NL]
Name is third in line for the crown,[NL]
and this makes him a prime target.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see. You [NL]
can come with me for now.[A][NL]
I've gotten two friends of mine[NL]
to help me out,[A][NL]
so they can protect you.[A]
[OpenLeft]I can fight myself, too![NL]
Where are we headed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Down south, to Country.[A][NL]
Right now, it's the only place[NL]
we might be able to find refuge.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x4C][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]Gahaha![NL]
This place is ripe for looting![A][NL]
Come on boys, let's grab all we can![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[OpenLeft]We have to go now![NL]
These bandits are gonna get us![A]
[OpenMidRight]No. We'll stay,[NL]
and help these people get out.[A][NL]
We can't abandon them here to die.[A][NL]
If you're coming with me,[NL]
you have to follow my terms.[A]
[OpenLeft]Very well.[NL]
We should hurry, though.[A][NL]
More are probably coming,[NL]
and we can't afford to stick around.[A][NL]
Let's get everyone out as soon as[NL]
we can.[A][X]
