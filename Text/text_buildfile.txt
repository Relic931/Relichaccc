[MidRight]We'll stop here for the night.[A]
[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]
[Left][LoadFace][0x6][0x1][FarLeft][LoadFace][0x7][0x1]
[Left]So, you all are heading south, huh?[A][NL]
Sounds pretty good at a time like this.[A]
[MidRight]Indeed it is.[A][NL]
It's a shame the route is plagued[NL]
by bandits.[A][NL]
It's been rough so far.[A]
[FarLeft]How about we tag along?[A][NL]
We don't have any other plans,[NL]
and we're proficient at fighting.[A]
[MidRight]Seriously?[NL]
Just like that?[A][NL]
I'd be fine with that.[A][NL]
[Left]Just to be clear,[A][NL]
we wouldn't have to bring[NL]
any money or supplies, right?[A]
[MidRight]Ah, there it is.[A][NL]
No, we'll take care of it all.[A][X]

[MidLeft][LoadMC][MidRight][LoadFace][0x10][0x1]
[MidLeft]What was that?[A]
[MidRight]Must be bandits![A][NL]
Quick, we have to evacuate[NL]
the village![A]
[MidLeft]Alright.[NL]
We'll need to be quick,[A][NL]
since they probably have more[NL]
backup coming soon,[A][NL]
and from all sides.[A][NL]
We can't afford to slow down.[A]
[MidRight]Brigands will be coming from[NL]
every corner of the town.[A][NL]
We have to get to the houses[NL]
as quickly as we can,[A][NL]
or else they'll be destroyed.[A][X]

[OpenFarRight]I can't thank you enough[NL]
for helping me back there.[A][NL]
If you need healing, I'd be more[NL]
than willing to lend you my staff.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Thank you so much.[A][NL]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]So, Name.[NL]
Where are we off to next?[A]
[OpenRight]We should keep moving south.[A][NL]
We can make it to Town in[NL]
a few days,[A][NL]
and we'll stay there for a night.[A][NL]
[OpenLeft]If I may interrupt,[A][NL]
wouldn't staying in one place[NL]
make it easier to be attacked?[A][NL]
[OpenRight]We don't have a choice.[A][NL]
Besides, I doubt we can avoid[NL]
conflict for long.[A][NL]
Town might have some people[NL]
willing to join us.[A]
[OpenLeft]That sounds reasonable[NL]
to me.[A][NL]
Name, are you ready to go?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]Yes, I'm ready.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Now that Father is dead,[NL]
where is his will?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]He hadn't written it.[A][NL]
But seeing as I am the eldest son,[NL]
it is only natural that[NL]
I assume his position as king.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Like hell it is![A][NL]
You're so utterly incompetent,[A][NL]
the country would fall the very day[NL]
you assumed the position.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You will accept me as the ruler,[A][NL]
or I will remove you from[NL]
this castle at once![A]
[OpenMidRight]You have no power over me![A][NL]
I will bring my forces,[NL]
and make you pay for this![A]
[OpenMidLeft]If it is war you desire, then it is[NL]
war you will receive.[A][NL]
I will mercilessly destroy you[NL]
and show who the true ruler here is.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]War...?[NL]
I can't stay here...[A][NL]
Where should I go, though?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
[OpenMidLeft]Perhaps we should seek refuge[NL]
with that merchant friend of yours?[A][NL]
I don't know of anyone else who would[NL]
take us in.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Name, you can't come![NL]
It's too dangerous, you should stay here.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]You know very well I can't leave you[NL]
behind, Name.[A][NL]
Now come, let us make our[NL]
escape with haste.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Very well.[A][X]

[OpenLeft]Name, you've gotta help us![A]
[OpenMidRight]Huh? Name?[A][NL]
What are you doing outside of the[NL]
castle? It's dangerous here.[A][NL]
You must know there's been a lot of[NL]
chaos since your brothers[A][NL]
began fighting.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]I believe it is no longer[NL]
safe for us anywhere.[A][NL]
Name is third in line for the crown,[NL]
and this makes him a prime target.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I see.You [NL]
can come with me for now.[A][NL]
I've got two friends of mine[NL]
to help protect me,[A][NL]
and they can protect you too.[A]
[OpenLeft]I can fight myself, too![NL]
Where are we headed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]Down south, to Country.[A][NL]
Right now, it's the only place[NL]
we might be able to find refuge.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x55][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]Gahaha![NL]
This place is ripe for looting![A][NL]
Come on boys, let's grab all we can![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x10][0x1]
[OpenLeft]We have to go now![NL]
These bandits are gonna get us![A]
[OpenMidRight]No. We'll stay,[NL]
and help these people get out.[A][NL]
We can't abandon them here to die.[A][NL]
If you're coming with me,[NL]
you have to follow my terms.[A]
[OpenLeft]Very well.[NL]
We should hurry, though.[A][NL]
More are probably coming,[NL]
and we can't afford to stick around.[A][NL]
Let's get everyone out as soon as[NL]
we can.[A][X]
