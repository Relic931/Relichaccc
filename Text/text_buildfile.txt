[FarLeft]As you can see, the path is heavily guarded.[A][NL]
They'll have griffon riders and pegasus[NL]
riders coming in from all sides, too,[A][NL]
once they realise we're here.[A]
[Right]So we have to move quickly?[NL]
I can do that.[A]
[FarLeft]That's right.[A][NL]
There's also the possibility[NL]
that they'll get people to close in[anl]
from behind us.[a]
[Left]And what of those houses?[NL]
It's a bit odd that people live here, no?[a]
[FarLeft]It's well protected and alongside[NL]
a well traveled road,[anl]
so it's not as bad as you'd think.[NL]
If you try to enter their homes, though,[anl]
I don't know what'll happen.[a]

# 0x0911
[MidLeft][LoadTransporter][MidRight][LoadMC]
[MidRight]So, you got us access?[A][NL]
I'm tired of going around from town[NL]
to town and collecting all the people up.[A]
[MidLeft]Listen. These people would have[NL]
died without us.[A][NL]
If it means saving some lives,[NL]
why wouldn't you be okay with what we've been doing?[A]
[MidRight]It sounds a lot worse when[NL]
you put it like that.[A][NL]
Anyways, we're ready to go, right?[A]
[MidLeft]Yeah. The bridge is heavily guarded,[A][NL]
so a pegasus knight will be coming with[NL]
us to make sure we get across alright.[A]
[MidRight]Then let's get going.[A]
[Clear][MidLeft]
[MidRight]We've wasted enough time already.[A][X]

# 0x0910
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x5B][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadCurrent]
[OpenMidLeft]Oh! You must be traveling south.[NL]
Take this with you.[A][X]

# 0x0909
[FarLeft][LoadTransporter][Left][LoadJagen][MidRight][LoadMC]
[MidRight]So what's the plan now?[NL]
And why are we out here, anyways?[A]
[FarLeft]I know someone who can[NL]
get us access to the landbridge[A][NL]
we need to cross to get to safety.[NL]
She lives over in that inn.[A]
[Left]And what of those houses?[A]
[FarLeft]These are soldiers, not bandits.[A][NL]
They'll leave the people in the houses alone,[NL]
but bandits might come out later.[A][NL]
Is everyone clear on what we need to do?[A]
[MidRight]Yep.[A][X]

# 0x0908
[FarRight][LoadMC][Right][LoadTransporter][Left][LoadJagen]
[Left]Where to next, Frederik?[A]
[Right]There shouldn't be any more[NL]
stops until Place.[A]
Just be prepared,[A][NL]
since we may have to fight[NL]
through some of Evans' troops.[A][NL]
The situation has only worsened[NL]
since the fighting began,[A][NL]
and so the two princes have[NL]
been encroaching on once peaceful territory.[A]
[FarRight]Evans...What about Hans?[A]
[Left]He's probably conceded[NL]
most of the north by now.[A][NL]
There are more important places[NL]
for him to control, anyways.[A]
[Right]Let's hope we don't run into[NL]
either army at all, though.[A][NL]
They'll be much stronger than[NL]
these mere chaotic bandits[A][NL]
we've fought till now.[A][X]

# 0x0907
[MidRight][LoadTransporter][MidLeft][LoadFace][0x0F][0x1]
[MidLeft]Sir, sir! Please help me![A]
[MidRight]What is it?[A]
[MidLeft]Bandits attacked my home out of the blue,[NL]
and I fled while I could.[A][NL]
However, my sister and the[NL]
other villagers have been left behind.[A][NL]
Please, you have to help them![A]
[MidRight]Very well, I'll inform the rest.[A][NL]
How far is your home from here?[A]
[MidLeft]Less than two hours on horseback,[NL]
now hurry![A][X]

# 0x0919
[FarRight][LoadTransporter][Right][LoadFace][0x0F][0x1][MidLeft][LoadFace][0x0E][0x1]
[Right]Stratton![NL]
You managed to avoid those thugs![A]
[MidLeft]*huff*Barely.[NL]
Genevieve is still out there, though.[A]
[FarRight]Don't worry,[NL]
we'll take care of it.[A][NL]
Can you still fight?[A]
[MidLeft]Yes, but I don't want to.[A]
[Right]Stratton![NL]
Don't you care about Genevieve?[A]
[MidLeft]Yes, but-[A]
[FarRight]I don't think you have a choice.[A][NL]
Those bandits are getting awfully close.[A]
[MidLeft]Fine.[A][NL]
I'll just stay behind you guys,[NL]
attacking from afar.[A][X]

# 0x091A
[FarRight][LoadMC][Right][LoadJagen][MidLeft][LoadTransporter]
[FarRight] I thought you said no more delays![A][NL]
Who knows if we'll even[NL]
make it at this rate![A]
[Right]There aren't any more larger[NL]
villages between here and Place.[A][NL]
Plus, bandits aren't bothering with their[NL]
usual prowling of the countryside,[A][NL]
since they'd rather take advantage of[NL]
the civil unrest and lack of[A][NL]
protection in towns.[A]
[Right]Fine.[A][NL]
I get that these people[NL]
are in danger,[A][NL]
but we might be in[NL]
danger too if we don't hurry.[A]
[FarRight][ClearFace]
[MidLeft]...[A]
[Right]He's young.[A][NL]
It's only natural that[NL]
he's this hotheaded.[A]
[MidLeft]I know,[NL]
but I've got a bad feeling about him.[A][X]

# 0x0905
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1][Left][LoadMC][FarLeft][LoadJagen]
[MidRight]We'll be staying at this[NL]
inn for the night,[A][NL]
so you should get some rest.[A]
[Left][Clear][FarLeft][Clear]
[Left][LoadFace][0x9][0x1][FarLeft][LoadFace][0x8][0x1]
[Left]So, where are you all[NL]
headed in a time like this?[A]
[MidRight]Where else but south?[A][NL]
There's no peaceful place[NL]
to stay in an empire at war.[A]
[Left]You're absolutely right,[NL]
my friend.[A][NL]
That's why we're traveling south, too.[A]
[FarLeft]If you wouldn't mind,[NL]
we could tag along with you guys.[A][NL]
You seem a little vulnerable to[NL]
bandits and the like with how[A][NL]
small your group is.[A]
[MidRight]I'd appreciate that.[A][NL]
We've got enough money and supplies[NL]
to sustain a few more people too,[A][NL]
so that wouldn't be an issue.[A][X]

# 0x0906
[MidLeft][LoadMC][MidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[MidLeft]What was that?![A]
[MidRight]Bandits must be looting the town![A]
[MidLeft]Let's get out, then![A]
[MidRight]Not so quick, Oscar.[A][NL]
There are people here who need help.[A]
[MidLeft]Again?[A][NL]
Haven't we already taken[NL]
enough people with us?[A]
[MidRight]Listen, we're only leaving[NL]
once we make sure everyone is safe.[A][NL]
Just worry about protecting yourself,[A][NL]
since [ToggleRed]these bandits must[NL]
be coming in from every corner of town.[ToggleRed][A]
[MidLeft]Fine.[A][NL]
Let's move quickly,[A][NL]
before there are too[NL]
many of them to handle.[A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1][OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x7][0x1]
[OpenFarRight]Thank you so much for saving me.[A][NL]
I know it's not much,[NL]
but here's some gold,[A][NL]
and I can help you out[NL]
with my healing abilities.[A]
[OpenRight]Thank you.[A][NL]
We'll be sure to keep you safe.[A]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenFarLeft]So is that it? Let's go![A]
[Left]Speaking of that,[NL]
where are we headed, Frederik?[A]
[OpenRight]Down to the southern border,[NL]
into Country.[A][NL]
It's the only place where[NL]
we can guarantee our safety.[A][NL]
Right now, our next stop[NL]
is Falespern.[A][NL]
Then we can plan out[NL]
our next move from there.[A][X]

[OpenMidRight]Father has passed away,[A][NL]
but he didn't leave any indication[NL]
of who should succeed him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I am the oldest between us,[NL]
so naturally, I will take the throne.[A]
[OpenMidRight]What? No, youre incompetent![NL]
The day you take control of this empire[A][NL]
is the day this country falls into ruin![A]
[OpenMidLeft]How dare you speak to your elder like that![A][NL]
If you want power so badly,[NL]
then you must pry it from my lifeless hands![A]
[OpenMidRight]If I must, I will.[A][X]

# 0x0913
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x50][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x49][0x1]
[OpenMidLeft]You'll pay for this![A][NL]
I will gather the military and[NL]
make sure you understand your place.[A][NL]
[MidRight]The military is loyal to me, not you.[A][NL]
My forces will stop your madness[NL]
swiftly and easily.[A]

[OpenMidRight]What are we going to do, Brecker?[A][NL]
A civil war is about to start and[NL]
I'm going to be caught right[A][NL]
in the middle of it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I know a merchant who lives in the north.[A][NL]
I'm sure he'd be willing to give us[NL]
some shelter, for the time being.[A]
[OpenMidRight]I guess we don't have much choice,[A][NL]
do we?[A][NL]
Very well, let us be on our way.[A][X]


# 0x0904
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[FarLeft]Frederik! It's good to see you again.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Brecker? What are you doing here?[A][NL]
And is that the prince?[A][NL]
What is he doing out here in[NL]
the middle of a civil war?[A]
[OpenFarLeft]He wasn't safe at the castle.[NL]
Can we stay with you?[A]
[OpenMidRight]That's fine, but[NL]
I am heading out of here soon.[A][NL]
Bandit attacks have ramped up as of late[NL]
due to the chaos going on,[A][NL]
so a friend of mine and[NL]
her son are coming with me.[A]
[FarLeft]Thank you so much.[NL]
Let's get going, then.[A]
[OpenMidRight]Wait.[A][NL]
There are still people who haven't[NL]
had a chance to leave their homes yet.[A][NL]
We've got to help them![A]
[OpenLeft]What about helping ourselves?[A][NL]
I haven't ever fought before.[A]
[MidRight]Well, you'd better learn quickly.[A][NL]
But don't worry,[NL]
as soon as we get everyone to safety,[A][NL]
we're out of here.[A]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x4C][0x1]
[OpenMidRight]Gahaha![NL]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x1][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x14][0x1]
[OpenLeft]We have to go now![NL]
These bandits are gonna get us![A]
[OpenMidRight]No. We'll stay,[NL]
and help these people get out.[A][NL]
We can't abandon them here to die.[A][NL]
If you're coming with me,[NL]
you have to follow my terms.[A]
[OpenLeft]Very well.[NL]
We should hurry, though.[A][NL]
More are probably coming,[NL]
and we can't afford to stick around.[A][NL]

we can.[A][X]
